# Quadtree

A simple quadtree implementation in kotlin.
Has different implementations, one optimized for lookup speed, one for insertion speed.

TODO:
- Dynamic growing of root Quadrant
- Removing of elements
- Find by rectangle intersection
- Find performance hot spots
- Actually use minSize from Quadtree Options
